# Functional Requirements

## 1. Introduction
Describe the overall purpose of the functional requirements.

## 2. Use Cases / User Stories
- *As an [actor], I want to [action], so that [outcome].*
- Example: *As an analyst, I want to query data, so that I can identify market anomalies.*

## 3. Functional Requirements
Each requirement should be uniquely numbered (FR-1, FR-2, ...).

| ID   | Requirement | Priority | Rationale |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| FR-1 | The system shall provide a login mechanism. | High | Security |
| FR-2 | The system shall allow users to export results to CSV. | Medium | Usability |

## 4. Data Requirements
- Define key datasets, inputs, and outputs.
- Specify constraints (e.g., data size, formats).

## 5. Interfaces
- User interfaces (UI mockups if needed).  
- API endpoints or system-to-system interactions.  

## 6. Assumptions & Dependencies
- Example: “System assumes data availability from source X.”
